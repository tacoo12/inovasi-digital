# Game Pengukuhan Bacaan Mad

This is an educational game designed to help Year 1 students learn about the "Bacaan Mad" topic in Islamic Education. The game allows students to practice identifying the correct harakat (vowel marks) for Quranic verses by adjusting gears that represent different harakat levels.

## Features

- Interactive gears with three levels each (2, 4, and 6 harakat) for fathah, dhommah, and kasrah.
- Feedback system with pop-up messages in Jawi ("Betul" in green, "Salah" in red).
- Colorful interface with a light cyan background, green borders, and vibrant buttons.
